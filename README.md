# RT-chatbot

## Introduction
This project introduces a health education robot for the Radiation Oncology Department. The need for this robot arises from the desire to provide 24/7 service and to bring healthcare closer to patients.

## Technology
The robot uses the NVIDIA Inference Microservice (NIM) with llama3-70b-instruct as the agent's brain. It integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology to acquire professional knowledge related to the hospital.

## Proof-of-Concept
NIM helps to quickly achieve a proof-of-concept, significantly reducing the complexity of the project.

## Interface
The robot uses a commonly used communication software, Line Bot, as an interface to enhance the user experience for patients.

## Conclusion
This project aims to bring healthcare closer to patients by providing a 24/7 service. By integrating advanced technologies and user-friendly interfaces, we hope to make a significant contribution to the field of health education in the Radiation Oncology Department.
